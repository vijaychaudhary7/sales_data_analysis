# Sales Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

- **Purpose:** Analyze sales data for business decision-making.
- **Tools Used:** Python for data analysis, Power BI for final visualizations.

In this project "Sales Data Analysis" I focused on extracting valuable insights from sales data to support data-driven decision-making. 
This analysis will help to uncover sales trends, identify top-selling products, and calculate essential revenue metrics.

## Project Components:

Data Analysis (Python):

In this project, I used Python to analyze the data. Key steps like:

- Aggregating data by product to find top-selling products.
- Calculating metrics such as total sales and profit margins.
- Exploring sales trends over time, including monthly and hourly patterns.
- Visualizations (Power BI):

The project's primary focus is on the analysis of sales data to derive actionable insights. By combining Python for data analysis and Power BI for visualization, it provides a comprehensive solution for understanding and leveraging sales data to enhance business performance.
